# botFormularioAima

I needed an appointment to be attended to at AIMA, one of the few points of contact is through their web form.
To increase my chances of them seeing my message, with Node and puppeteer I created a bot that completes and submits the form every 5 minutes.

Update: The result was successful, after 8 days working and more than 1300 cycles carried out, the organization found my message and responded to me.
